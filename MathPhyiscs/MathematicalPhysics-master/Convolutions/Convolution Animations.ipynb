    "#Animating Convolutions\n",
    "\n",
    "We've been talking about [convolutions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution) in my mathematical physics class, and I thought some animations would help. Surprisingly, I couldn't find a great example on the web. I did find what looks like some nice matlab code at [Swarthmore](http://lpsa.swarthmore.edu/Convolution/Convolution3.html)[1], and the wikipedia page linked above has some nice animations with matlab source, but I don't have matlab. I probably spent more time looking for a pre-existing matplotlib animation than it took me to cook one up[2].\n",

    "Mathematically, the [convolution] of two functions $f$ and $g$ is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$f \\ast g = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(\\tau)g(t-\\tau)d\\tau$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the integration $d\\tau$ gives us back a function of $t$, and that we can think of a convolution as \"sliding\" one function across the other. In fact, [\"A Student's Guide to Fourier Transforms\"](http://books.google.com/books/about/A_Student_s_Guide_to_Fourier_Transforms.html?id=_T99VW0ARfkC) by J.F. James (one of my favorite books, although I own the 1995 edition) has the explanation I like to use, defining things in terms of a signal and an instrument function. You can find good enough explanations in those places (and in others) that I'll just point you elsewhere instead of going through the math/intuition here. Instead, I want to make some animations.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, first of all, let's handle our standard imports and then define a bunch of shapes that we'll want to convolve. I'll calculate the convolution numerically, so I'll set up the total number of points (`nx`) here. I'll also decide that we're going to plot the convolution from $-3\\pi$ to $3\\pi$ (`fullx`) and each of the functions across a smaller domain $-\\pi$ to $\\pi$ (`subx`) that slides across the full domain. You can add more function just by adding them to the `Shapes` dictionary. Later on, we'll use the dictionary keys to make dropdown menus and plot legends.[2]\n",

    "I've already posted [a bit](http://www.mglerner.com/blog/?p=28) about how fantastic Jake Vanderplas's [JSAnimation](https://github.com/jakevdp/JSAnimation) package is, so let's jump right in. The only remaining mathematical question is how, exactly, we're going to calculate the convolution. There are built-in functions that will do this for us (most notably `numpy.convolve` and `scipy.signal.fftconvolve`). Part of the point of writing this all out, however, is to write as much of the code (or, at least, the mathematical part of the code) ourselves. \n",
    "\n",
    "We understand the convolution as an integral, so let's just calculate the integral like a Reimann sum: for a given offset $t$, we'll calculate the integral by dividing it up into chunks of length $d\\tau$ (called $dx$ in the code below) and adding up each $f(\\tau)g(\\tau-t)d\\tau$ like they were little Reimann sum rectangles centered at each of the discrete points in our arrays, each with width $d\\tau$. That also makes our definition of a $\\delta$ function obvious: it has height $1/dx$ and width $dx$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also make things look pretty: one function in blue, one in green, and we build up the convolution piece by piece as a dashed line.\n",
    "\n",
    "One caveat: note that we need to reverse one of the functions thanks to the minus sign in our integral. If we don't do this, the output will look flipped around the y-axis. (students: I highly encourage you to play with this notebook interactively to see that for yourself. Just replace `_u1rev` with `_u1`.\n",

    "The \"`if i == 0: ...`\" part just resets our convolution to zero in case we loop through again."
