{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c3f8dc","input":"**Exercise 5.3.9.** An undamped spring-mass-damper system with mass $m = 2$ kg and spring constant $k = 8$ newtons per meter is at equilibrium position $u = 0$ and is not moving at time $t = 0$. No additional forces act on the mass until time $t = 10$ seconds, but for $t > 10$ a force $f(t) = 40$ newtons is applied to the mass. At time $t = 15$ seconds the force drops to zero. Find the position of the mass for $t > 0$ by formulating an appropriate ODE with initial conditions and solving with the Laplace transform. Plot the solution on the interval $0 ≤ t ≤ 25$.","pos":7,"type":"cell"}
