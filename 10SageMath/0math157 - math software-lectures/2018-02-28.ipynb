    "- CAPE evaluations are available! They close Monday, March 19 at 8am. Since this course is highly experimental, your feedback will be very helpful for shaping future offerings.\n",
    "- Attendance scores through Wednesday, February 21 are now posted on TritonEd. Contact Peter with any issues.\n",
    "- My office hours this week will be held Thursday, 3:30-4:30 (rather than 4-5).\n",
    "- Grades for HW5 will be available shortly.\n",
    "- The HW6 solution set is available.\n",
    "- HW 7 is now available. Some early comments:\n",
    " - Problem 1: The \"Orange\" dataset is not available via statsmodels. However, you can access it directly from R using the `rpy2` module. Also, some students have had issues with the \"FacetGrid\" command crashing their kernel; if this occurs, simply state that and skip this part of the problem. (Added in class: try restarting your project before giving up.)\n",
    " - Problem 3a: The mpg dataset is in ggplot, not statsmodels: `from ggplot import mpg`\n",

    "- If you are unable to be on campus during week 10, please contact me immediately to set up a workaround for the final project.\n",
