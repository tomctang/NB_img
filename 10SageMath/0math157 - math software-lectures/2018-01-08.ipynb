    "Welcome to Math 157! This course is an introduction to the use of mathematical software. Although mathematics is still largely taught as a pencil-and-paper (and chalk) subject, this approach ignores the fundamental role played by computing technology in the subject. This course will introduce students to a broad but coherent collection of open-source software tools, and to diverse examples of their use in mathematical study and research."

I recommend using either a small laptop or a large (at least 8 inches diagonally) tablet with a physical keyboard. (You are of course free to use a different device outside of class!)"
