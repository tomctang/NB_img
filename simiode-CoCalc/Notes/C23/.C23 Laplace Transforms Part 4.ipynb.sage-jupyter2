{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"815f1b","input":"**Exercise 5.1.1.** A patient with no morphine in their body is given a 5 mg bolus of morphine at 9:00 AM, followed by infusion at a rate of 1 mg of morphine per hour. At 9:00 PM, the infusion rate is increased to 1.5 mg per hour. At 6:00 AM, a 5 mg bolus is administered and the infusion rate is decreased to 1 mg per hour.  Formulate an appropriate differential equation, solve using Laplace transforms, and graph the amount of morphine in the patient over the first 24 hours.","pos":2,"type":"cell"}
{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"e95e62","input":"**Exercise 5.4.5b.** A salt tank contains 100 liters of pure water at time $t = 0$, when salty water begins flowing into the tank at 2 liters per minute. The incoming liquid contains a concentration of 0.1 kg of salt per liter. The well-stirred liquid flows out of the tank at 2 liters per minute. At time $t = 20$ minutes 5 kg of salt is dumped into the tank and dissolves instantaneously.  Model the situation with a first-order ODE, with $x(t)$ as the mass of salt in the tank at time $t$. Solve this\nODE using the Laplace transform.  Plot the solution to make sure it’s sensible.","pos":1,"type":"cell"}
{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ee7545","input":"**Exercise 5.4.8.** An unforced spring-mass-damper system obeys $2u''(t) + 4u'(t) + 52u(t) = 0$ where $u(t)$ is the position of the mass, with initial conditions $u(0) = 1$ and $u'\n(0) = −1$.\n\n(a) Solve the ODE to find the position u(t) of the mass.\n\n(b) The system is underdamped, so the mass repeatedly passes through equilibrium. Find the second positive time $t = t_2$ at which the mass passes through equilibrium.\n\n(c) Suppose that at time $t = t_2$ a hammer blow of impulse $A$ is to be applied to the mass to bring it to a dead stop. What should $A$ equal? ($A$ can be negative.) Hint: it should counteract the momentum of the mass.\n\n(d) Solve the ODE $2u''(t) + 4u'(t) + 52u(t) = Aδ(t −t_2)$ with initial conditions $u(0) = 1$ and $u'(0) = −1$,and $A$ and $t_2$ as from parts (b) and (c). Plot the solution on the range $0 ≤ t ≤ 2$\n.","pos":3,"type":"cell"}
