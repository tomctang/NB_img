    "CoCalc combines the capabilities of a rudimentary word processor (powered by markdown and LaTeX) and a sophisticated calculator (powered by the SageMath kernel).  Notebooks are partitioned into markdown and code cells. If you followed the first instruction above,  you have already seen how to edit a markdown cell: double-click, type the text you want, and press shift-enter to make it look pretty.  Lines starting with one to six hash marks (#) are converted into header font sizes and become part of the table of contents for the document.  Text surrounded by single underscores or asterisks are *emphasized*, and text surrounded by two underscores or asterisks are **strongly emphasized**.  More details about the markdown syntax can be obtained by clicking on 'Help' in the (lowest) menu bar and then clicking on 'Markdown' in the dropdown menu.\n",
